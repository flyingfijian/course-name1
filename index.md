Hi there, and welcome to my blog! My name is flyingfijian, and I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you.

I'm a System Engineer specialising in the VMware space, and I've been working in this field for about 8 years now. Throughout my career, I've learned a lot about VMware , and I'm excited to use this platform to share my thoughts/experiences with you.

Aside from my professional pursuits, I'm also passionate about Aviation and travelling In my free time, you can usually find me a Airport, or at my computer planing for my next trip.

Through this blog, I hope to create a space where we can engage in meaningful conversations about VMware. 

Thank you for stopping by, and I look forward to getting to know you better!
